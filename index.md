## [](#subheader-1-3)Purpose
At first I create **TEMPest** cause I didn't find anything like it. I just wanted to manage easily, with a few commands my temporary directories.  
Any resemblance with other projects is not intentional.  
  
I created it to be used by myself, I put it here to practice different stuff and allow people who want to, to use it.  
Thumbs up if you like it ! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye::+1:


## [](#subheader-1-3)So what does it do?
With **TEMPest** you can "register" some paths as "<u>targets</u>" and then operate deletion on all of them at once.  
It also offers some overview on current temporary stuff.  



## [](#subheader-1-4)Plans
Yeah I do have plans. Plans for the future!!  
For now, **TEMPest** is not fully tested on Windows, but I'd like to use it on my Windows machines too, so I'm woriking on that.
